Title:
   Search IncrementalIndexing Load Generator ( SILG ) for Search performance Analysis.

Introduction:
   For Performance testing search features and for search regression runs, we need to generate two types of workloads. A search query 
   workload and and incr indexing workload.  This tool ( SILG ) is about generating the latter. The tool uses prod 'I'  log lines to 
   generate the incr indexing load.

Definition of property variables used in build.xml:
	
INPUT_PATH - base input dir relative to which all logs would be read.
OUTPUT_PATH - base output dir relative to which all intermediate and final incr indexing logs would be written.
SOURCE_FILE_CSV -  This points to the csv log source to be consumed by IncrIndexing generator.
LOAD_FILE_CSV   -  This points to where the final incr indexing load would be stored to be consumed by 
                   the incr indexing servlet ( as of Dec 2012 ). This load file needs to be copied to on 
                   the load server in the lab.
THR - threshold for the entity count, when fetching records from the db.
GET_TABLE_SIZE - TRUE/FALSE, which says if we want to compute the count of each entity type, for each orgid. 
                                    This is a costly operation, and would be needed only once, unless we nuke this data again. 
                                    If this flag is "true", only then the count is recomputed for each entity type, per org. 
                                    Otherwise, we just compute the input for incremental indexing, assuming that stage 1's output 
                                    is already available.


** PreReqs **
- ant 1.7 and up
- Set INDEXER_LOGS_UNZIPPED_ILINES in src/main/script/main.sh to the location of the unzipped Iline logs. ( Set to "/home/asakhuja/Documents/indexer_unzipped_ilines/Ilines.log" )
- Set DB/sid in '/home/asakhuja/sandbox/aditya/IncrIndexingSearch/config/config.yaml' ( where you are checking out the project )
- Set SILG_HOME to the root dir of this project in src/main/script/main.sh ( set to  "/home/asakhuja/sandbox/aditya/IncrIndexingSearch")

** Execution **
ssh @asakhuja-wsl2.internal.salesforce.com
cd /home/asakhuja/sandbox/aditya/IncrIndexingSearch 
cd src/main/script
sh main.sh Add.all_Ilines.log 20120501_cr_filtered_1000orgs.log top_1000_orgs_only.csv false
